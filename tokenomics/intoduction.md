## What is the point of Green DAO?

Green DAO incentivises new supply of Base Carbon Tonnes (BCT) on the blockchain through the gDAO token.&#x20;



gDAO is a building block for unlocking the carbon economy â€” an economy where more economic activity leads to an acceleration in planetary regeneration rather than more damage to our planet.

The gDAO ecosystem and monetary policy are managed by the Klima DAO. This way we guarantee transparent decision making and long-term stability.&#x20;

When we achieve scale, demand for gBTC via gDAO will bridge with supply in the traditional carbon markets, enabling the market forces that we unlock to disrupt the status quo and drive change.

The point is to create a new monetary system backed by carbon, and to build an economy around it.&#x20;
