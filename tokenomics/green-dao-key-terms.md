# Green DAO Key Terms

Klima DAO Key Terms

**gBTC:** Green Bitcoin.

**gDAO:** the Green DAO token. Each gDAO is backed by a gBTC locked in the Green DAO treasury. gDAO has an intrinsic value underpinned by the cost of gBTCs. gBTC is an ERC20 token.

**TCO2:** Toucan carbon tokens**:** TCO2 is the general term for fungible tokenized carbon offsets. When you fractionalize a BatchNFT, the ERC20 token will have TCO2- as a prefix, followed by an information-rich name that includes the registry of origin, the project, the vintage, and so on. More information on the tokenization process can be found in the [Toucan docs](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/).

**Base Carbon Tonnes (BCTs):** BCT is the token for the base carbon pool, which accepts any TCO2, independent of project type (e.g. forestry carbon offsets, renewable energy carbon offsets or methane capture offsets, ...). At this time, the only requirements for TCO2s to be eligible for deposit into the BCT pool are: the TCO2 is verified by Verra, and has vintage later than 2008. BCT is a Toucan Pool token, so see their [documentation ](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/pool/pools)for more details.

**Bonding:** market participants can acquire gDAO at a discounted rate via the bonding mechanism. The bond contract requires the user to deposit gBTCs, gBTC/USDC LP, or gDAO/gBTC LPs in return for the discounted gDAO over a fixed vesting period.

**Staking:** market participants can lock-up their gDAO tokens for fixed periods, to receive additional gDAO as reward in return. This happens via a rebasing mechanism of the staked return token (sgDAO), which can be unstaked to receive an equal amount of gDAO.

**VCU:** Verified Carbon Unit as part of the Verra Carbon Standard (VCS). Under the VCS Program, projects are issued unique carbon credits known as Verified Carbon Units or VCUs. Each VCU represents a reduction or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) achieved by a project. VCUs are characterized by a number of [quality assurance principles](https://verra.org/project/vcs-quality-assurance-principles/) which are confirmed through the project [validation and verification](https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/validation-verification/) process. VCUs are ultimately purchased and retired by an end user as a means of offsetting their emissions. All VCU issuance and retirement records are publicly available on the [Verra Registry](https://registry.verra.org).
