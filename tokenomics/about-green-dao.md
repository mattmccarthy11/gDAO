# About Green DAO

## Objectives

By building a market-driven system that internalizes the cost of carbon, Green DAO will deliver tangible results in the real-world by increasing the amount of carbon backed bitcoin locked within the treasury, thereby reducing supply on the open market.

Green DAO will leverage the existing carbon market infrastructure and improve on it; this will internalize the robustness of existing supply whilst disrupting demand conditions by bridging traditional offset markets with the liquidity of the crypto markets.&#x20;

Green DAO will serve the web3 ecosystem by offering accountability for those that contribute, rewards for stakeholders, and a stake in governance for those that participate.

## How do I participate in Green DAO?

**Green DAO development:** Join the  [Discord](https://discord.gg/klimadao) to become a G and hear about Protocol developments. Those who wish to be involved in Protocol Governance should also join the Discord to be onboarded by a member of the team.&#x20;

**Participation in the carbon economy:** BCTs are the underlying asset within the GreenDAO treasury and their flow into the treasury underpins protocol growth. BCTs can be created from real-world Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) via the [Toucan Protocol](https://co2ken.io). Bonders provide gBTC LP or gBTC tokens in exchange for discounted KLIMA tokens after a fixed vesting period. Once gDAO tokens are held, stakers stake their gDAO tokens in return for more gDAO tokens.

## Who created Green DAO?

Green DAO was inspired by [Olympus DAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance). It was conceptualised and built by a distributed public team.
