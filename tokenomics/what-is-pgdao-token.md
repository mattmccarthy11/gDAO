# What is pGDAO Token

## How it works <a href="#3314" id="3314"></a>

The private sale was not for gDAO. We cannot pre-mine and sell the actual OHM token. If we did, we would need to take 1 gBTC per gDAO sold in addition to the actual raise to make sure the tokens are backed. This would be really inefficient and capital intensive. So, how did we do it?

Through a sale of pGDAO. pGDAO is a precursor derivative of gDAO; it gives the holder the option to mint GDAO by burning pGDAO and providing the intrinsic value of gDAO. For example, an investor would provide 1 gBTC and 1 pOHM to mint 1 GDAO.

This makes it similar to an option. pGDAO is worth the price of gDAO minus intrinsic value, and it only makes sense to redeem it when gDAO is above intrinsic value. This ensures that our incentives are aligned to keep the premium alive.

But it doesn’t stop there. pGDAO is also vested based on supply. As GDAO supply grows, more pGDAO become available to redeem. So we don’t get an upfront payoff or an arbitrary date at which tokens have vested. We need supply to grow too.

\
We believe this creates the most optimal incentive alignment you could ask for. Tokens vest along with supply, and are only redeemed when we trade with a positive extrinsic value. We the team, investors and advisors, don’t only want supply to increase, or price to go up, we want both. And so do you.

### The Specifics

Team, investor, and advisor pOHM cumulatively vest as 11.8% of GDAO supply. This means that at 1m GDAO supply, a maximum of 118k pGDAO can be redeemed. At 10m GDAO supply, it’s 1.18m pGDAO. pGDAO holders finish vesting anywhere from 2b to 5b supply, so this is a long term bet. There’s a lot of upside for holders, but it is dependent on actual growth of the protocol.

The breakdown is as follows:

* Team: 330m pGDAO and 7.8% supply
* Investors: 70m pGDAO and 3% supply
* Advisors: 50m pGDAO and 1% supply
* DAO: 550m pGDAO and no supply cap (community can decide that!)\


### The Plan

These funds will be used to support the project for as long as possible so we can allow the DAO to stockpile funds and start off with a strong footing. But we still dislike that not everyone got the opportunity.

So, though we can’t promise anything because we do not control the DAO, eventually we’d like to propose a DAO offering of pGDAO. This would give everyone the same opportunity as well as increase the DAO’s capitalization.

That decision is reserved entirely to you, the token holder and community member. If you think this is already too much, we won’t do it. If you believe, like we do, that this creates exceptionally strong incentive alignment that far outweighs the cost, then perhaps we will.

But all that is for the future. This is what we have already done. If you find this disagreeable or you feel like you’ve been wronged, please, for the love of Zeus, do not participate. We do not want you to feel that way, and the best solution is to not buy the coin. If you do, you’ve signed off through your actions.\
